I recently bought a [MSP430 Launchpad](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/MSP430_LaunchPad) from Texas Instruments. The [MSP430](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_MSP430) is a family of low power, low cost microcontrollers. To make sure my development environment was setup correctly I wanted to start with one of the simplest things to do, blink a LED.

I have a wire connected to P1.0, another connected to GND, a 180 ohm resistor, and an LED 180 Ohm resistor. The code is compiled with GCC.


blink.c

``` c
#include <msp430.h>

int main(void) {
  WDTCTL = WDTPW + WDTHOLD; // Stop watchdog timer
  P1DIR = 0x01; // Set pin to output, 0b00000001

  for (;;) {
    volatile unsigned int i;
    P1OUT ^= 0x01; // toggle LED1 (P1.0) on/off, 0b00000001
    i = 50000;
    do (i--);
    while (i != 0);
  }
}
```

Makefile

```
CC=msp430-gcc
CFLAGS=-Os -Wall -g -mmcu=msp430g2553

OBJS=main.o


all: $(OBJS)
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o main.elf $(OBJS)

%.o: %.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

clean:
        rm -fr main.elf $(OBJS)
```

We build, then use [mspdebug](http://mspdebug.sourceforge.net/) to load the program onto the chip from the command line.

```
$ make
$ mspdebug rf2500
(mspdebug) prog main.elf

Writing  108 bytes at c000 [section: .text]...

(mspdebug) exit
```

Now we have a LED blinking.
