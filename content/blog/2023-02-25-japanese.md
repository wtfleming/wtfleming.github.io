TODO list what my goals were - play japanese video games that have not been translated
  Boku No Natsuyasumi, Tokimeki Memorial
  

## Duolingo

Great for Hiragana Katakana

aka va akai - not explained, but sometimes it's both
Translate sushi from English to Japanese, Japanese has English furigana...

Seems to be geared for casual / language tourists

Thought i'd like the gamification - turned out to be very offputting
Ended up intentionally 

Way too easy to answer questions without any thinking/learning

found myself doing exercises that gave the most points instead of most useful


seems like a good resource if you have a trip to Japan coming up and want to learn a little, but not for fluency

## Tango JLPT N5

Japanese From Zero!
  Not a fan of the progressive kana, but for the right person/learner this is probably a good resource
