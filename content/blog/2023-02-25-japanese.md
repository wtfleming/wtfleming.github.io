Started in January 10, 2023
TODO list what my goals were - play japanese video games that have not been translated
  Boku No Natsuyasumi, Tokimeki Memorial
  

## Duolingo

Great for Hiragana Katakana

aka va akai - not explained, but sometimes it's both
Translate sushi from English to Japanese, Japanese has English furigana...

Seems to be geared for casual / language tourists

Thought i'd like the gamification - turned out to be very offputting
Ended up intentionally 

Way too easy to answer questions without any thinking/learning

found myself doing exercises that gave the most points instead of most useful


seems like a good resource if you have a trip to Japan coming up and want to learn a little, but not for fluency

## Misc

Japanese From Zero!
  Not a fan of the progressive kana, but for the right person/learner this is probably a good resource

## Kanji

Radicals
Example of a cat and animal / tree sapling or rice paddy+grass


Katamari Damashi

## Podcasts
Nihongo con Teppei
 
 

## YouTube

## Immersion

Youtube, twitch streamers, netflix
how to add subtitles to anime
manga for beginners like Yotsuba
games - animal crossing (lots of words for everyday things) has furigana
  some things like pokemon have hiragana, but since no spaces between words, can be difficult for someone learning the language
